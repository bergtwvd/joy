Joy is yet another implementation of [Jakarta JSON Processing API] (JSON-P).

## Key Features

* Fully compliant with the latest specification of [Jakarta JSON Processing API].
* Passes more than 2,000 tests provided by [JSON-P Test Suite].
* Works perfect with [Jakarta JSON Binding API] (JSON-B).
* Supports YAML parsing and reading with the help of [snakeyaml-engine].
* Supports Java 8 and higher.
* Can be used as a modular jar in Java 9 and higher.

## Getting Started

### Joy version 2

Joy version 2 is an implementation of [Jakarta JSON Processing API] version 2.x, which is now defined in the `jakarta.json` package instead of `javax.json` package.

For using this version, the following 2 dependencies neeed to be added in your `pom.xml` as an API and its implementation, respectively.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.json</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.json-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.leadpony.joy</groupId>
    <artifactId>joy-classic</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Joy version 1

Joy version 1 is an implementation of [Jakarta JSON Processing API] version 1, which was defined in `javax.json` package. For using this version, the following 2 dependencies neeed to be added in your `pom.xml` as an API and its implementation, respectively.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.json</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.json-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.6</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.leadpony.joy</groupId>
    <artifactId>joy</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Beyond the Standard API

For using the provider-specific API shown below, `scope` element of `dependency` must be changed from `runtime` to `compile` or be removed entirely.

The provider-specific API is available in `org.leadpony.joy.api` package.

### JsonGenerator

The following configuration properties are added.

* INDENTATION_SIZE

  Specifies the number of spaces to be used as an
  indentation. The value of the property must be an integer. By default the
  number is 4.

* TAB_INDENTATION

  Uses a tab for indentation instead of spaces. The
  value of the property could be anything.

## YAML Support

All you need to do for parsing/reading YAML documents is switching the implementation from `joy-classic` to `joy-yaml` as shown below:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.leadpony.joy</groupId>
    <artifactId>joy-yaml</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

Please note that there are some restrictions in the current implementation of `joy-yaml`.
* Aliases are not supported and cause the parser/reader to throw an exception.
* Anchors are silently ignored.
* Multiple documents are not supported.
* Both generating and writing YAML documents are not supported yet.
